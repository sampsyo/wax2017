# The 2017 Workshop on Approximate Computing Across the Stack

<img src="waxlogo500.jpg" style="max-width: 120px;" class="illus">

Welcome to the 2017 Workshop on Approximate Computing Across the Stack (WAX)! WAX is a venue for research focusing on computing with unreliability and inexactness.
It will be co-located with [ASPLOS 2017][].

See the [Call for Participation][cfp].
You can submit peer-reviewed position papers, lightning talks, and discussion topics---or, we hope, all three.

[cfp]: cfp.html

We're still finalizing the timeline, but here are the tentative dates:

* February 20, 2017: position papers due
* March 6, 2017: notification for position papers
* March 20, 2017: lightning-talk slides and discussion topics due
* April 9, 2017: workshop day
